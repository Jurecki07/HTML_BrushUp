THE BOX MODEL
Introduction to the Box Model
Browsers load HTML elements with default position values. This often leads to an unexpected and unwanted user experience, while limiting the views you can create. In this lesson you will learn about the box model, an important concept to understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website.

If you have used HTML and CSS, you have unknowingly seen aspects of the box model. For example, if you have set the background color of an element, you may have noticed that the color was applied not only to the area directly behind the element, but also to the area to the right of the element. Also, if you have aligned text, you know it is aligned relative to something. What is that something?

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as "living" inside of a box. This is what is meant by the box model.

For example, when you change the background color of an element, you change the background color of its entire box.

In this lesson, you'll learn about the following aspects of the box model:

The dimensions of an element's box.
The borders of an element's box.
The paddings of an element's box.
The margins of an element's box.
Let's begin!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The box model comprises the set of properties which define parts of an element that take up space on a web page. The model includes the content area's size (width and height) and the element's padding, border, and margin. The properties include:

Width and height — specifies the width and height of the content area.
Padding — specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.
Border — specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.
Margin — specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.
The image to the right is a visual representation of the box model.

Open the box model image in a new tab so you can reference the box model as you move through the lesson.

Height and Width
An element's content has two dimensions: a height and a width. By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box.

The CSS height and width properties can be used to modify these default dimensions.

p {
height: 80px;
width: 240px;
}
In this example, the height and width of paragraph elements are set to 80 pixels and 240 pixels, respectively — the px in the code above stands for pixels.

Pixels allow you to set the exact size of an element's box (width and height). When the width and height of an element are set in pixels, it will be the same size on all devices — an element that fills a laptop screen will overflow a mobile screen.

THE BOX MODEL
Borders
A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.

width — The thickness of the border. A border's thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, or thick.
style — The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of 10 different styles. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, and solid.
color — The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including 140 built-in color keywords.
p {
border: 3px solid coral;
}
In the example above, the border has a width of 3 pixels, a style of solid and a color of coral. All three properties are set in one line of code.

The default border is medium none color, where color is the current color of the element. If width, style, or color are not set in the CSS file, the web browser assigns the default value for that property.

p.content-header {
height: 80px;
width: 240px;
border: solid coral;
}
In this example, the border style is set to solid and the color is set to coral. The width is not set, so it defaults to medium.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Border Radius
Ever since we revealed the borders of boxes, you may have noticed that the borders highlight the true shape of an element's box: square. Thanks to CSS, a border doesn't have to be square.

You can modify the corners of an element's border box with the border-radius property.

div.container {
border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);
border-radius: 5px;
}
The code in the example above will set all four corners of the border to a radius of 5 pixels (i.e. the same curvature that a circle with radius 5 pixels would have).

You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the height of the box, or to 100%.

div.container {
height: 60px;
width: 60px;
border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);
border-radius: 100%;
}
The code in the example above creates a div that is a perfect circle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Padding I
The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding. Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it. In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.

p.content-header {
border: 3px solid coral;
padding: 10px;
}
The code in this example puts 10 pixels of space between the content of the paragraph (the text) and the borders, on all four sides.

The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make content look less cramped.

If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box's content, you can use the following properties:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
Each property affects the padding on only one side of the box's content, giving you more flexibility in customization.

p.content-header {
border: 3px solid fuschia;
padding-bottom: 10px;
}
In the example above, only the bottom side of the paragraph's content will have a padding of 10 pixels
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Padding II
Another implementation of the padding property lets you specify exactly how much padding there should be on each side of the content in a single declaration.

p.content-header {
border: 3px solid grey;
padding: 6px 11px 4px 9px;
}
In the example above, the four values 6px 11px 4px 9px correspond to the amount of padding in a clockwise rotation. In order, it specifies the amount of padding on the top (6 pixels), right (11 pixels), bottom (4 pixels), and left (9 pixels) sides of the content.

When using this implementation of the padding property, we must specify a padding value for all four sides of the element.

However, if the top and bottom values for padding will equal each other, and the left and right values for padding will also equal each other, you can use the following shortcut:

p.content-header {
padding: 5px 10px;
}
The first value, 5px, sets the padding value for the top and bottom sides of the content. The second value, 10px, sets the padding value for the left and right sides of the content.
