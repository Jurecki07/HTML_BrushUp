THE BOX MODEL
Introduction to the Box Model
Browsers load HTML elements with default position values. This often leads to an unexpected and unwanted user experience, while limiting the views you can create. In this lesson you will learn about the box model, an important concept to understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website.

If you have used HTML and CSS, you have unknowingly seen aspects of the box model. For example, if you have set the background color of an element, you may have noticed that the color was applied not only to the area directly behind the element, but also to the area to the right of the element. Also, if you have aligned text, you know it is aligned relative to something. What is that something?

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as "living" inside of a box. This is what is meant by the box model.

For example, when you change the background color of an element, you change the background color of its entire box.

In this lesson, you'll learn about the following aspects of the box model:

The dimensions of an element's box.
The borders of an element's box.
The paddings of an element's box.
The margins of an element's box.
Let's begin!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The box model comprises the set of properties which define parts of an element that take up space on a web page. The model includes the content area's size (width and height) and the element's padding, border, and margin. The properties include:

Width and height — specifies the width and height of the content area.
Padding — specifies the amount of space between the content area and the border.
Border — specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.
Margin — specifies the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.
The image to the right is a visual representation of the box model.

Height and Width
An element's content has two dimensions: a height and a width. By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box.

The CSS height and width properties can be used to modify these default dimensions.

p {
height: 80px;
width: 240px;
}
In this example, the height and width of paragraph elements are set to 80 pixels and 240 pixels, respectively — the px in the code above stands for pixels.

Pixels allow you to set the exact size of an element's box (width and height). When the width and height of an element are set in pixels, it will be the same size on all devices — an element that fills a laptop screen will overflow a mobile screen.

THE BOX MODEL
Borders
A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.

width — The thickness of the border. A border's thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, or thick.
style — The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of 10 different styles. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, and solid.
color — The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including 140 built-in color keywords.
p {
border: 3px solid coral;
}
In the example above, the border has a width of 3 pixels, a style of solid and a color of coral. All three properties are set in one line of code.

The default border is medium none color, where color is the current color of the element. If width, style, or color are not set in the CSS file, the web browser assigns the default value for that property.

p.content-header {
height: 80px;
width: 240px;
border: solid coral;
}
In this example, the border style is set to solid and the color is set to coral. The width is not set, so it defaults to medium.
