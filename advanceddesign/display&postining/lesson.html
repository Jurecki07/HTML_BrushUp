DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Flow of HTML
A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in HTML.

In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.

In this lesson, you will learn five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the browser:

position
display
z-index
float
clear
Each of these properties will allow us to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used in conjunction with any other styling properties you may know.

Take a look at the block-level elements in the image below:



Block-level elements like these boxes create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they prevent other elements from appearing in the same horizontal space. The boxes in the image above were created with the following CSS:

.boxes {
width: 120px;
height: 70px;
}
and the following HTML:

<div class="boxes"></div>
<div class="boxes"></div>
Notice the block-level elements in the image above take up their own line of space and therefore don't overlap each other. In the browser to the right you can see block-level elements also consistently appear on the left side of the browser. This is the default position for block-level elements.

The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of four values:

static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)
relative
absolute
fixed
In the next few exercises, you'll learn about the values in items 2, 3, and 4 above. For now, it's important to understand that if you favor the default position of an HTML element, you don't need to set its position property.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Position: Relative
One way to modify the default position of an element is by setting its position property to relative.

This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page.

.box-bottom {
background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
position: relative;
}
Although the code in the example above instructs the browser to expect a relative positioning of the div, it does not specify where the div should be positioned on the page.

.box-bottom {
background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
position: relative;
top: 20px;
left: 50px;
}
In the example above, the <div> has been positioned using two of the four offset properties. The valid offset properties are:

    top - moves the element down.
    bottom - moves the element up.
    left - moves the element right.
    right - moves the element left.
    In the example above, the <div> will be moved down 20 pixels and to the right 50 pixels from its default static position. The image below displays the new position of the box. The dotted line represents where the statically positioned (default) box was positioned.



        Units for offset properties can be specified in pixels, ems, or percentages. Note that offset properties will not work if the value of the element's position property is the default static.
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </div>
    Position: Absolute
    Another way of modifying the position of an element is by setting its position to absolute.

    When an element's position is set to absolute all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element.

    .box-bottom {
    background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 50px;
    }
    In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> will be moved down and right from the top left corner of the view. If offset properties weren't specified, the top box would be entirely covered by the bottom box. Take a look at the gif below:



        The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.

        In the next exercise, we will compare the scrolling of absolute elements with fixed elements.
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </div>
    Position: Fixed
    When an element's position is set to absolute, as in the last exercise, the element will scroll with the rest of the document when a user scrolls.

    We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed.

    .box-bottom {
    background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    left: 50px;
    }
    In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> will remain fixed to its position no matter where the user scrolls on the page, like in the image below:



        This technique is often used for navigation bars on a web page.
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </div>
    Z-Index
    When boxes on a web page have a combination of different positions, the boxes (and therefore, their content) can overlap with each other, making the content difficult to read or consume.

    .box-top {
    background-color: Aquamarine;
    }

    .box-bottom {
    background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 50px;
    }
    In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> ignores the .box-top <div> and overlaps it as a user scrolls.

        The z-index property controls how far "back" or how far "forward" an element should appear on the web page when elements overlap. This can be thought of the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind shallower elements.

        The z-index property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be displayed on the web page.

        .box-top {
        background-color: Aquamarine;
        position: relative;
        z-index: 2;
        }

        .box-bottom {
        background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
        position: absolute;
        top: 20px;
        left: 50px;
        z-index: 1;
        }
        In the example above, we set the .box-top position to relative and the z-index to 2. We changed position to relative, because the z-index property does not work on static elements. The z-index of 2 moves the .box-top element forward, because it is greater than the .box-bottom z-index, 1. See the example image below:



        In the image above, you can see the top box is moved in front of the bottom box. </div>
    </div>

</div>
