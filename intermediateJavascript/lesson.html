Blocks and Scope
Before we talk more about scope, we first need to talk about blocks.

We've seen blocks used before in functions and if statements. A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. Blocks help us group one or more statements together and serve as an important structural marker for our code.

A block of code could be a function, like this:

const logSkyColor = () => {
let color = 'blue';
console.log(color); // blue
};
Notice that the function body is actually a block of code.

Observe the block in an if statement:

if (dusk) {
let color = 'pink';
console.log(color); // pink
};
In the next few exercises, we'll see how blocks define the scope of variables.

SCOPE

Global Scope
Scope is the context in which our variables are declared. We think about scope in relation to blocks because variables can exist either outside of or within these blocks.

In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks. These variables are called global variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any code in the program, including code in blocks.

Let's take a look at an example of global scope:

const color = 'blue'

const returnSkyColor = () => {
return color; // blue
};

console.log(returnSkyColor()); // blue
Even though the color variable is defined outside of the block, it can be accessed in the function block, giving it global scope.
In turn, color can be accessed within the returnSkyColor function block.
Let's work with global variables to see how data can be accessible from any place within a program.
